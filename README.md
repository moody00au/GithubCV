Chrome Extension to Create A Detailed GitHub CV Based on User Profile

Overview:
The system is a Chrome Extension powered by an LLM like GPT-4, designed to create detailed and interactive character sheets (or CVs) for GitHub users. The character sheets are constructed using the user's profile activity, comments, code, requests, and any other publicly available data. The system dynamically builds a narrative of the user's activity timeline and manages workload based on the volume of the user's data. It uses a fractal approach to progressively delve into details of the user's activity.

System Architecture:
Chrome Extension (Front-End Interface):

This extension will be the primary user interface, responsible for initiating requests to GitHub and our back-end servers.

Server (Back-End System):

The server hosts the LLM (Large Language Model), like GPT-4, and is responsible for data processing, narrative generation, and CV formatting. The server has several components:

Data Acquisition Module: This module communicates with GitHub (through the GitHub API) to gather a user's comments, code, requests, and other publicly available data.

Data Processing Module: This module prepares the acquired data for the LLM, which involves tasks like data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation. It manages the workload based on the volume of the user's data, with a fractal approach to delve into the details progressively.

Narrative Generation Module (GPT-4 API): This module feeds the processed data into the LLM and instructs it to generate a narrative of the user's activity timeline. It also summarizes the data based on the total information available.

CV Formatting Module: After receiving the narrative from the LLM, this module formats the narrative into a well-structured CV, suitable for display on the front-end.

Communication Layer: This layer is responsible for managing communication between the Chrome extension and the server, as well as the server and the GPT-4 API.

GitHub API:

The system uses the GitHub API to gather additional data about the user, including their repositories, commits, and other contributions.

Database:

Depending on the system requirements, a database might be necessary to store user data, generated narratives, or user preferences. The database could also aid in managing the workload efficiently by storing partially processed data.

Security and Privacy:

Ensure the system securely handles user data and respects privacy. All data transfers should be secure, and the system must comply with relevant data protection regulations.
